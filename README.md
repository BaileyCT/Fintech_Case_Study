## Landscape:

Capital Markets

Over the last 5-10 years the capital market and its players have changed and had to adapt to the new everchanging technology world. The main triggers that led the movement were technology and changes in regulation.
The rise of cryptocurrencies and FinTech pushed the agenda of ‘transparency, less leverage and improved governance’ into the industry. Where before there was enforcement of controlling markets, now there is free competition arising and making the market more complex for its players. 

another important factor is how efficiently organizations invest in technologies and train their workforces to utilize them. Megatrends.

Another lesson banks could learn from fintechs is how to leverage customer data and analytics to digitally deliver hyperpersonalized services and engage customers—together with partners—in new and differentiated ways.
